			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer
			 board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, 
			 thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience! As one or 
			 our members told us:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			&ldquo;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as 
			the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.&rdquo;

					Research Curator at the Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. 
					Sampson's research has focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous
