			educate, and entertain our audience! As one or our members told us:
		<blockquote>
			"Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of
			knowledge...and that is priceless."</blockquote>
		</p>
		<h2>Our Ticket Packages</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Season Package: $95</li>
			<li>Patron Package: $200</li>
